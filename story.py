          + "These can take you all over the realm, throughout towns, mountains, forests, and caves. ")

    input("On one such mission you found yourself in a predicament you had not faced previously. "
          + "You went off into the Shadowed Woods one evening in search of the illusive Disappearing Stag. ")

    input("While traveling you got separated from your party, and while you were searching for them you took a wrong step in the dark and tripped over a protruding root. "
          + "On impact you lost consciousness, and have only now started to wake up. ")

    input("Now you find yourself in a gloomy-looking cave. " 
          + "The cave is barely lit, with the only light coming from mysterious glowing stones scattered throughout the walls. "
          + "As you're looking around you realize that there is a humanoid figure standing in the shadows. ")

    input("The figure, noticing your movement, starts to speak, saying "
          + "\"Welcome traveler. "
          + "You are probably quite confused right now, but it is no matter, your fears will soon be assuaged. "
          + "You see, all is not lost now that you have arrived. "
          + "I have been unable to leave this cave to find a suitable champion, but a few hours ago you fell out of the sky. ")

    input("It seems you ran into a portal and it brought you here, and knocked you unconscious along the way. "
          + "Do not worry though, because there is a way for you to return. "
          + "While the dungeon ahead contains many rooms, there is an exit that will get you out. "
          + "But, you must be wary, as there are many nasty creatures that lurk along the way. "
          + "Despite that, there is hope now. "
          + "You are not the only one trapped down here with those fiends, and clearing out an exit path would mean freedom for others as well. ")

    input("To aid you in your journey through these dungeons, take this decently sharp stick and shield looking plank of wood. "
          + "It appears that any weapon or shield you had before coming here is gone, so you will need to make do with these for now. "
          + "While I am not able to venture very far into the dungeons, I have been able to glance more items along the way. "
          + "If you can find more suitable weapons and armor, that should be quite helpful in getting to the end. ")

    input("I must bid you farewell for now, but if luck serves us, then I will likely see you again soon.\"")

    input("With those last words the figure vanishes into the darkness with no clear method for doing so. ")
    
    input("\nOn that note, dear traveler, you have quite the journey ahead of you. \n")
